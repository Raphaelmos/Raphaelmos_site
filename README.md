This is my website. Below is the link : 
https://raphaelmos.github.io/Raphaelmos_site/

This repository is under construction and will change but it is functional

## TODO : 

-Remove the "staticness" of the website.<br>
-Possible change of the palette colors ✅<br> 
-Update it to 2024 with all the new projects made.✅ (2-3 projects missing but can be found on repositories) <br> 
-Improve the projects part for a better look ✅ <br>
-Link the projects all together to make the web projects usable directly in the portfolio without having to go link after link <br>
-Adapt it for all devices not only laptop ✅
### Currently working on many types of landing sites
