# Raphaelmos_site

This is my website. Below is the link : 
https://raphaelmos.github.io/Raphaelmos_site/

This repository is under construction and will change 

## TODO : 

-Remove the "staticness" of the website.<br>
-Possible change of the palette colors <br>
-Update it to 2024 with all the new projects made.<br>
-Improve the projects part for a better look
-Link the projects all together to make the web projects usable directly in the portfolio without having to go link after link
### Currently working on many types of landing sites
